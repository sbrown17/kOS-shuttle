# kOS-shuttle
File collection for the Shuttle and it's automation script that will eventually get it to orbit and back home with minimal kerbal or human input.

Note: It has been a while since I've tested this, but I believe it can currently get to orbit. That is it so far. More to come once I get my Desktop set up again!
